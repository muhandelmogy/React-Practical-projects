Welcome!
Note:
Take care, the equation number state on calculator.js is mutable which is wrong. the mutation comes from push method " if you don't know". However, I tried to make it immutable by using the spread method but I couldn't. It just doesn't work. if you can solve this problem I will be grateful.
